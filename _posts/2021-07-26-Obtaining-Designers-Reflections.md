## Collecting Designer's Reflections

You can collect Designer's Reflections from each of the following sources:

* [Main Story and Mind Maze](#mainstory)
* [Workshop](#wshop)
* [Designer Intel Hub](#intel)
* [Sea of Fantasy](#fantasy)
* [Diamond Arena](#arena)
* [Pinnacle Battles](#pinnacle)
* [Events](#event)

### <a name="mainstory">Main Story and Mind Maze</a>

Your first Designer's Reflection, *Leonid - Twinkle Twinkle*, is given to you on stage 1-5 of the Main Story. You can only receive *Twinkle Twinkle* once through this method, but its **echo** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup> can be obtained through the Sea of Fantasy.

*Leonid - Twinkle Twinkle* is the only Designer's Reflection you can get simply by playing the Main Story. However, you should complete Main Story and Mind Maze stages to unlock sets in the Workshop, which can be used to collect more Designer's Reflections.

To access the Main Story from the home page, tap `Start Journey` at the bottom of the page, then tap `Main Story` or `Mind Maze`.

> **Did you know?**  
To access the Mind Maze and unlock additional Mind Maze stages, you need to progress in the Main Story.

### <a name="wshop">Workshop</a>

As you progress through the Main Story and Mind Maze, you will unlock clothing sets in the Workshop. You can collect the set's Designer's Reflection by Invoking it after crafting all of the pieces.

To access the Workshop from the home page, tap `Design Center` in the bottom left corner, then tap `Workshop`. You can also access the Workshop from the Main Story or Mind Maze by tapping the set's name in the bottom left corner.

<sup>Workshop landing page. Use the tabs at the top to view different sets. Tap on a set to begin crafting</sup>

Crafting the Workshop set pieces requires both materials and Gold. Tap any material to learn its source(s).

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/WorkshopSource.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Tap a material to learn its source. A material may have multiple sources. You can use the `Go` button as a shortcut to the item's source</sup>

When you complete the set, tap on the `Invoke` tab. You can tap the `Invoke` button at the bottom of the page to receive the Designer's Reflection after meeting any additional requirements. After Invoking the first time, you can Re-Invoke the set for echoes <sup>[1](#echo)</sup>, which you will need later for upgrading. Re-Invoking a set requires materials and Gold; you do not need to craft the set a second time.

<sup>Tap the Invoke tab to view the Invoke page</sup>

<sup>After you've Invoked a Designer's Reflection, you can Reinvoke it for echoes</sup>

> **Did you know?**  
A Designer's Reflection may have additional requirements that need to be met before you can Invoke it. You can find these requirements on the Invoke tab. Once you meet a requirement, you will see a check mark to the right.

#### How To Invoke a Designer's Reflection from the Workshop:

1. Unlock the set pieces by completing the required stages
2. Go to the Workshop and tap on the set you wish you craft
3. Collect the required materials and craft all of the pieces of the set
4. Tap the `Invoke` tab at the top of the Set Crafting page in the Workshop
5. Tap the `Invoke` button at the bottom of the page

### <a name="intel">Designer Intel Hub</a>

At the Designer Intel Hub, Nikki can investigate various designers to write Designer Columns. During an investigation, you will read story snippets, wait for a period of time, and sometimes donate a small amount of Gold or Pink Gems. All of these actions will reward you with *Exclusive Intel* points which you can exchange for rewards like Designer's Reflections, and *Mysterious Clues* which you can exchange for more Designer Columns. Exclusive Intel cannot be transferred from one designer to another, but leftover Intel can be exchanged for rewards from any Columns featuring the same designer.

To access the Intel Hub, you will first need to complete the Main Story stage 2-3. Then, from the home page, tap `Design Center` in the bottom left corner, then tap `Designer Intel Hub`. 

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/DesignCenterNav.jpg" width=300>

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/IntelHubLanding.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>The Designer Intel Hub. Each section shown here is a Designer Column</sup>

To perform an Investigation, tap on one of the Designer Columns, then tap `Start Investigation`. Alternatively, you can tap `Auto-Investigate`, which will perform all of the investigation actions automatically. You have the option to skip the wait time for Auto-Investigations by spending Pink Gems. 

Once you have earned enough Exclusive Intel, tap the reward you want to exchange your Intel for. You will then read a short snippet of story and select a dialog option. You will receive reward that you selected no matter which dialog option you choose.

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/IntelHubPage.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Example of a Designer Column. Your Exclusive Intel points for the column's designer can be found around the middle of the page</sup>

Intel Hub rewards must be unlocked in a specific order. You may need to buy other items with Exclusive Intel before you can unlock the Designer's Reflection.

Designer Columns can be unlocked by either progressing through the Main Story or using Mysterious Clues. You can preview the reward for a locked Designer Column by tapping `Rewards` on that column.

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/IntelHubRewards.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Tap `Rewards` on a locked Designer Column to see what rewards are available before you unlock it</sup>

> **Did you know?**  
Some of the Designer Column rewards may include Designer's Reflections that you have already collected using other methods. If you are looking for echoes <sup>[1](#echo)</sup> to upgrade your Designer's Reflections and you aren't sure where to find them, try looking for its clothing set in the Intel Hub.

#### How To Earn Designer's Reflections From the Intel Hub:

1. Unlock Designer Columns by either progressing through the Main Story or using Mysterious Clues
2. Tap on a Designer Column
3. Complete investigations to collect Exclusive Intel
4. Tap the Designer's Reflection to buy it with Exclusive Intel

### <a name="fantasy">Sea of Fantasy</a>

The Sea of Fantasy is a type of **gacha** <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> game in *Shining Nikki.* You can summon random items from the Sea of Fantasy using *Fantasy Tickets*, *Gleaming Shards* and *Gleaming Stars*. Among the items you can win are Designer's Reflections.

To find the Sea of Fantasy, tap `Gate of Heart` at the bottom of the home page. 

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/GateNav.jpg" width=300>

There are 2 versions of the Sea of Fantasy. *Sea of Fantasy: Gleam* features an increased drop rate for featured sets. These featured sets change weekly. The same items are available in the regular Sea of Fantasy, but the drop rates are a little bit different. You can cycle through the different gacha <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> games in the Gate of Heart by tapping the arrows on the left and right of your screen.

There is a third gacha <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> game in the Gate of Heart called the *Sea of Mystery*. There are currently no Designer's Reflections available to win in the Sea of Mystery.

The following table shows the drop rate of Designer's Reflections in the Gate of Heart by rarity. For a complete list of available items and drop rates for each game in the Gate of Heart, tap `All Items` in the upper right corner of your screen.

| Gacha Name | Designer's Reflections Available | SR Drop Rate | SSR Drop Rate | UR Drop Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Sea of Fantasy | Available | 6.2% | 3.0% | 0.5% | |
| Sea of Fantasy: Gleam | Available | 5.58% for featured sets; 0.62% for other sets | 2.7% for featured sets; 0.3% for other sets | 0.5% | Featured sets rotate weekly |
| Sea of Mystery | Unavailable | | | | Only clothing can be won in Sea of Mystery |

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/GleamRewards.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Tap `All Items` for a complete list of available items and drop rates</sup>

#### Fantasy Tickets

Fantasy Tickets can be collected in a variety of ways, such as sign-in rewards, events, achievements, and more. Fantasy Tickets can also be purchased for Pink Gems, Guild Coins, Event Currency, or real money in the **Shop**<sup>[3](#shop)</sup>. You can quickly exchange your Pink Gems for Fantasy Tickets by tapping `Summon` without any tickets in your inventory or `Summon x10` with less than 10 tickets in your inventory.
  
<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/fantasysummon.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Sea of Fantasy. You can see how many Fantasy Tickets you have in the bottom right corner</sup>

Summoning with 10 tickets at once will guarantee that you win at least one SSR item. Because many Designer's Reflections are rarity SSR and above, you may increase your odds of getting a Designer's Reflection by spending 10 Fantasy Tickets at once by tapping `Summon x10`. However, you are not guaranteed to get a Designer's Reflection on every summon, even if you use `Summon x10`. 

#### Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars

Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars are an additional currency that can be used to Summon in Sea of Fantasy: Gleam. Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars can be purchased with **Star Gems** <sup>[4](#stargem)</sup>. The drop rates when using Gleaming Shards or Gleaming Stars are no different than using Fantasy Tickets. They are just another currency you can use to play Sea of Fantasy: Gleam.

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/GleamHome.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Example of Sea of Fantasy: Gleam. The featured sets rotate weekly, so your view may be different. You can Summon using Star Gems by tapping the Exclusive Summon button.</sup>

> **Did you know?**  
Because there is randomness involved in gacha <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> games, there is a chance that you will receive duplicate items. Duplicate Designer's Reflections will automatically be turned into echoes <sup>[1](#echo)</sup>. Duplicate clothes and echoes can be decomposed for Gold and upgrade materials. 

#### How To Summon Designer's Reflections from the Sea of Fantasy:

1. Collect Fantasy Tickets and/or Star Gems
2. Tap `Gate of Heart`
3. Tap the arrows on the left and right of your screen to navigate to Sea of Fantasy or Sea of Fantasy: Gleam
4. Tap `Summon` or `Summon x10` to use Fantasy Tickets, or Tap `Exclusive Summon` to use Star Gems

### <a name="arena">Diamond Arena</a>

Stylists can compete against one another in the Diamond Arena for the chance to purchase exclusive clothing sets, including the set's Designer's Reflection. 

To locate the Diamond Arena from the home page, tap `Start Journey`, then tap `Diamond Arena`. 

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/StartJourney.jpg" width=300>

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/ArenaNav.jpg" width=300>

To unlock the Designer's Reflection from the current Diamond Arena Exclusive set, you must finish the weekly competition in the appropriate Tier or higher. To see which Tier you need to finish in, tap `Shop` in the bottom right corner to be taken to the Arena Shop, then tap `Exchange` to see the Diamond Arena Exclusive Clothing set.

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/ToArenaShop.jpg" width=300>

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/ArenaShop.jpg" width=300>   
<sup>Example of a Designer's Reflection in the Arena shop. In this example, you must finish the week in the *Ruler of Future Reversed: 1-star* Tier or higher to unlock *Mercury - Elves Elegy* for purchase. Once unlocked, you will need 1500 Flowers of Odes to purchase it</sup>

On the Diamond Arena page, tap `Dress Up` to coordinate three outfits based on the Weekly Theme. You compete with other stylists based on the Styling Power of all three outfits combined. Your combined Styling Power is also known as your *Competence*. 

You can see your current Competence and the Competence of your competitors listed beneath Tier Position. Your Competence updates in real time, so any upgrades you make to your Styling Power - such as changing any of your three outfits or upgrading your Designer's Reflections - will be updated automatically in your Competence score.

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/ArenaCompetenceTier.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Your Competence score is calculated based on the Styling Power of your three outfits</sup>

To challenge a stylist, tap on any of the 3 profile pictures at the bottom of the home page. Challenge stylists with a higher Tier Position than you to increase your own Tier Position. If you win against a stylist of a higher Tier, you will swap Tier Positions with the stylist you challenged; if you lose, your Tier Position will remain the same. You will receive the Diamond Arena currency *Flower of Odes* whether you win or lose. You can also tap the `Refresh` button to swap out the 3 stylists at the bottom of the page for 3 new ones.

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/ArenaOpponents.jpg" width=300>  
<sup>Example of Diamond Arena opponents. Increase your rank by defeating stylists with a higher Tier Position</sup>

When other stylists challenge and defeat you, your Tier Position will decrease. Remember: you unlock Diamond Arena Exclusives based on the Tier you *finish* the week in, so keep an eye on your Tier Position throughout the week to make sure you don't dip below the required Tier.

> **Did you know?**  
Unlocking a Diamond Arena Exclusive item for purchase only needs to be done once per Season. Even if you finish at a lower Tier in subsequent weeks, you may still purchase the items you unlocked previously.

#### How to Earn Designer's Reflections from the Diamond Arena:

1. Tap `Dress Up` and coordinate three outfits based on the Weekly Theme
2. Return to the Diamond Arena page and tap on a player to challenge them and collect Flowers of Odes
3. Increase your Tier by challenging players with a higher Tier Position than you
4. Finish at or above the required Tier to unlock the Designer's Reflection for purchase
6. Purchase the Designer's Reflection from the Arena Shop with Flowers of Odes before the end of the Season

### <a name="pinnacle">Pinnacle Battles</a>

Team up with other stylists to defeat a powerful opponent in Pinnacle Battles. Each time your team defeats the opponent, you will earn Shards of the opponent's Designer's Reflection, as well as Shards of the Pinnacle Battle Exclusive clothing set. You must buy every item in the set with Shards before you can unlock the Designer's Reflection.

To access Pinnacle Battles from the home page, tap on `Start Journey`, switch to the `Team` tab, then tap `Pinnacle Battles`.

### <a name="event">Events</a>

There is almost always some kind of special event going on in *Shining Nikki*. All current events will be shown to you when you start up the game. You can also use the `Events` button or `Notices` button on the home page to view the current events. 

<img src="https://lyn-f.github.io/DR-guide/EventInfoNav.jpg" width=300>

Events may have you completing daily activities, clearing special event stages, or playing a special event gacha <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> to earn rewards. Check each event's rewards to see if a Designer's Reflection is available and what you need to do to earn it. Event items are available for a limited time, so be sure to participate before you run out of time.
