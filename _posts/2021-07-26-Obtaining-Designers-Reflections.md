## Obtaining Designer's Reflections

To start using Designer's Reflections, you first need to learn where to collect them. Designer's Reflections are obtained in a variety of ways. In this section you will learn how to obtain Designer's Reflections from each of the following sources:

* Main Story and Mind Maze
* Workshop
* Designer Intel Hub
* Sea of Fantasy
* Diamond Arena
* Pinnacle Battle
* Events

### Main Story and Mind Maze

Your first Designer's Reflection, *Leonid - Twinkle Twinkle*, is obtained when you start stage 1-5 of the Main Story. Upon receiving it, you will be given a quick tutorial about equipping and using the Designer's Reflection during styling battles. You can only receive *Twinkle Twinkle* once through this method, but its **echo** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup> can be obtained through the Sea of Fantasy.

While *Leonid - Twinkle Twinkle* is the only Designer's Reflection you can get simply by playing the Main Story, completing Main Story stages - as well as Mind Maze stages, which are unlocked as you progress through the Main Story - also unlocks Workshop sets which can be used to obtain more Designer's Reflections.

To access the Main Story from the home page, tap `Start Journey` at the bottom of the page, then tap `Main Story` or `Mind Maze`.

To access the Mind Maze and unlock additional Mind Maze stages, you need to progress in the Main Story.

### Workshop

As you progress through the Main Story and Mind Maze, you will unlock clothing sets in the Workshop. Once you finish crafting every piece in a Workshop set, you can Invoke the set to receive its Designer's Reflection.

To access the Workshop from the home page, tap `Design Center` in the bottom left corner, then tap `Workshop`. You can also access the Workshop from the Main Story or Mind Maze by tapping the set's name in the bottom left corner.

Crafting the set pieces requires both materials and Gold. Tapping the material will show you how to obtain that material, as well as give you a shortcut to the material's source(s).

When you complete the set, tap on the `Invoke` tab. Once you have met all of the requirements, tap the `Invoke` button at the bottom to receive the Designer's Reflection. After Invoking the first time, you can Re-Invoke the set for **echoes** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup>. Re-Invoking a set requires materials and Gold; you do not need to craft the set a second time.

A Designer's Reflection may have additional requirements that need to be met before you can Invoke it. You can find these requirements on the Invoke tab. Once you meet a requirement, you will see a check mark to the right.

##### How To Invoke a Designer's Reflection:

3. Collect the required materials and craft all of the pieces of the set
4. Tap the `Invoke` tab at the top of the Set Crafting page in the Workshop

6. To Re-Invoke the Designer's Reflection, collect the required materials listed on the `Invoke` tab, then tap the `Re-Invoke` button

### Designer Intel Hub

At the Designer Intel Hub, Nikki can perform Investigations on various designers to write Designer Columns. Investigations entail reading story snippets, waiting for a timer to run down, and sometimes donating a small amount of Gold or Pink Gems. All of these actions will reward you with Exclusive Intel points, which you can exchange for rewards such as Designer's Reflections and **echoes** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup>, and Mysterious Clues, which you can use to unlock more Designer Columns. Keep in mind that Exclusive Intel cannot be transferred from one designer to another, but you can use your leftover Exclusive Intel on Designer Column rewards for the same designer.

To access the Intel Hub, you will first need to complete the Main Story stage 2-3. Then, from the home page, tap `Design Center` in the bottom left corner, then tap `Designer Intel Hub`. 

`add image of home page Design center, the design center and then the Intel hub page`

To perform an Investigation, tap on one of the Designer Columns, then tap `Start Investigation`. Alternatively, you can tap `Auto-Investigate`, which will perform all of the investigation actions automatically for you. If you Auto-Investigate, you also have the option to skip the wait time for Investigations at the cost of Pink Gems. Once you have earned enough Exclusive Intel, tap the reward you want to exchange your Intel for. You will then get to read a short snippet of story and choose a dialog option. No matter what you choose, you will still receive the reward.

Intel Hub rewards must be unlocked in order. In some cases, you may need to exchange for several rewards before you can get the Designer's Reflection.

Designer Columns can be unlocked by either progressing through the Main Story or using Mysterious Clues. Many of the Designer Column rewards include Designer's Reflections, but not all of them do. Be sure to check the rewards before unlocking a Designer Column with Mysterious Clues.

Some of the Designer Column rewards may include sets whose clothing pieces or Designer's Reflections you have already obtained using other methods. If you are looking for **echoes** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup> to upgrade your Designer's Reflections and you aren't sure where to obtain them, try looking for its clothing set in the Intel Hub. 

##### How To Obtain Designer's Reflections From the Intel Hub:

1. Unlock Designer Columns by either progressing through the Main Story or using Mysterious Clues
2. Tap on a Designer Column
3. Earn Exclusive Intel by performing Investigations
4. Return to the Designer Column page and exchange Exclusive Intel for any prerequisite rewards
5. Tap the Designer's Reflection to buy it with Exclusive Intel

### Sea of Fantasy

The Sea of Fantasy is a type of **gacha** <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> game in *Shining Nikki.* You can Summon random items from the Sea of Fantasy using **Fantasy Tickets**, **Gleaming Shards** and **Gleaming Stars**.

To find the Sea of Fantasy, tap `Gate of Heart` at the bottom of the home page. There are 2 versions of the Sea of Fantasy. *Sea of Fantasy: Gleam* features an increased drop rate for featured sets. These featured sets rotate weekly. The same items are available in the regular Sea of Fantasy, but the drop rates are a little bit different. You can cycle through the different gacha games in the Gate of Heart by tapping the arrows on the left and right of your screen.

There is a third gacha game in the Gate of Heart called the *Sea of Mystery*. There are currently no Designer's Reflections available to win in the Sea of Mystery.

`add images Gate of Heart`

The following table shows the drop rate of Designer's Reflections in the Gate of Heart by rarity. For a complete list of available items drop rates for each gacha game in the Gate of Heart, tap `All Items` in the upper right corner of your screen.

| Gacha Name | Designer's Reflections Available | SR Drop Rate | SSR Drop Rate | UR Drop Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Sea of Fantasy | Available | 6.2% | 3.0% | 0.5% | |
| Sea of Fantasy: Gleam | Available | 5.58% for featured sets; 0.62% for other sets | 2.7% for featured sets; 0.3% for other sets | 0.5% | Featured sets rotate weekly |
| Sea of Mystery | Unavailable | | | | Only clothing can be won in Sea of Mystery |

> **Did you know?**  
Because there is randomness involved in gacha games, there is a chance that you will receive duplicate items. Duplicate Designer's Reflections will automatically be turned into **echoes** `glossary echoes`. Duplicate clothes and echoes can be Decomposed for Gold and upgrade materials. See `upgrades section on decomposition` for more information.

##### Fantasy Tickets

Fantasy Tickets can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as sign-in rewards, events, achievements, and more. Fantasy Tickets can also be purchased for Pink Gems, Guild Coins, Event Currency, or real money in the **Shop**`glossary shop`. You can quickly exchange Pink Gems for Fantasy Tickets by tapping `Summon` without any tickets in your inventory or `Summon x10` with less than 10 tickets in your inventory.

Summoning with 10 tickets at once will guarantee that you win at least one SSR item. Because many Designer's Reflections are rarity SSR and above, you may increase your odds of getting a Designer's Reflection by spending 10 Fantasy Tickets at once by tapping `Summon x10`. Keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to get a Designer's Reflection on every Summon, even if you use Summon x10. 

##### Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars

Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars are an additional currency that can be used to Summon in Sea of Fantasy: Gleam. Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars can be purchased with **Star Gems** `glossary star gems`. The drop rates when using Gleaming Shards or Gleaming Stars are no different than using Fantasy Tickets. They are just another currency you can use to play Sea of Fantasy: Gleam. Keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to get a Designer's Reflection on every Summon.
