## Obtaining Designer's Reflections

To start using Designer's Reflections, you first need to learn where to collect them. Designer's Reflections are obtained in a variety of ways. In this section you will learn how to obtain Designer's Reflections from each of the following sources:

* [Main Story and Mind Maze](#mainstory)
* [Workshop](#wshop)
* [Designer Intel Hub](#intel)
* [Sea of Fantasy](#fantasy)
* [Diamond Arena](#arena)
* [Pinnacle Battle](#pinnacle)
* [Events](#event)

### <a name="mainstory">Main Story and Mind Maze</a>

Your first Designer's Reflection, *Leonid - Twinkle Twinkle*, is obtained when you start stage 1-5 of the Main Story. Upon receiving it, you will be given a quick tutorial about equipping and using the Designer's Reflection during styling battles. You can only receive *Twinkle Twinkle* once through this method, but its **echo** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup> can be obtained through the Sea of Fantasy.

While *Leonid - Twinkle Twinkle* is the only Designer's Reflection you can get simply by playing the Main Story, completing Main Story stages - as well as Mind Maze stages, which are unlocked as you progress through the Main Story - also unlocks Workshop sets which can be used to obtain more Designer's Reflections.

To access the Main Story from the home page, tap `Start Journey` at the bottom of the page, then tap `Main Story` or `Mind Maze`.

> **Did you know?**  
To access the Mind Maze and unlock additional Mind Maze stages, you need to progress in the Main Story.

### <a name="wshop">Workshop</a>

As you progress through the Main Story and Mind Maze, you will unlock clothing sets in the Workshop. Once you finish crafting every piece in a Workshop set, you can Invoke the set to receive its Designer's Reflection.

To access the Workshop from the home page, tap `Design Center` in the bottom left corner, then tap `Workshop`. You can also access the Workshop from the Main Story or Mind Maze by tapping the set's name in the bottom left corner.

Crafting the set pieces requires both materials and Gold. Tapping the material will show you how to obtain that material, as well as give you a shortcut to the material's source(s). 

`add image of Set Crafting page and material Source tab`

When you complete the set, tap on the `Invoke` tab. Once you have met all of the requirements, tap the `Invoke` button at the bottom to receive the Designer's Reflection. After Invoking the first time, you can Re-Invoke the set for **echoes** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup>. Re-Invoking a set requires materials and Gold; you do not need to craft the set a second time.

> **Did you know?**  
A Designer's Reflection may have additional requirements that need to be met before you can Invoke it. You can find these requirements on the Invoke tab. Once you meet a requirement, you will see a check mark to the right.

##### How To Invoke a Designer's Reflection:

1. Unlock the set pieces by completing the required stages
2. Go to the Workshop and tap on the set you wish you craft
3. Collect the required materials and craft all of the pieces of the set
4. Tap the `Invoke` tab at the top of the Set Crafting page in the Workshop
5. Tap the `Invoke` button at the bottom of the page to receive the Designer's Reflection
6. To Re-Invoke the Designer's Reflection, collect the required materials listed on the `Invoke` tab, then tap the `Re-Invoke` button

### <a name="intel">Designer Intel Hub</a>

At the Designer Intel Hub, Nikki can perform Investigations on various designers to write Designer Columns. Investigations entail reading story snippets, waiting for a timer to run down, and sometimes donating a small amount of Gold or Pink Gems. All of these actions will reward you with Exclusive Intel points which you can exchange for rewards like Designer's Reflections, and Mysterious Clues which you can use to unlock more Designer Columns. Exclusive Intel cannot be transferred from one designer to another, but leftover Intel can be used to exchange for rewards from any Columns featuring the same designer.

`add image of intel hub rewards`

To access the Intel Hub, you will first need to complete the Main Story stage 2-3. Then, from the home page, tap `Design Center` in the bottom left corner, then tap `Designer Intel Hub`. 

`add image of home page Design center, the design center and then the Intel hub page`

To perform an Investigation, tap on one of the Designer Columns, then tap `Start Investigation`. Alternatively, you can tap `Auto-Investigate`, which will perform all of the investigation actions automatically for you. If you Auto-Investigate, you also have the option to skip the wait time for Investigations at the cost of Pink Gems. Once you have earned enough Exclusive Intel, tap the reward you want to exchange your Intel for. You will then get to read a short snippet of story and choose a dialog option. No matter what you choose, you will still receive the reward.

`add image of investigations`

> **Did you know?**  
Intel Hub rewards must be unlocked in order. In some cases, you may need to exchange for several rewards before you can get the Designer's Reflection.

Designer Columns can be unlocked by either progressing through the Main Story or using Mysterious Clues. Many of the Designer Column rewards include Designer's Reflections, but not all of them do. Be sure to check the rewards before unlocking a Designer Column with Mysterious Clues.

`add images for Intel Hub`

> **Did you know?**  
Some of the Designer Column rewards may include sets whose clothing pieces or Designer's Reflections you have already obtained using other methods. If you are looking for **echoes** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup> to upgrade your Designer's Reflections and you aren't sure where to obtain them, try looking for its clothing set in the Intel Hub. 

##### How To Obtain Designer's Reflections From the Intel Hub:

1. Unlock Designer Columns by either progressing through the Main Story or using Mysterious Clues
2. Tap on a Designer Column
3. Earn Exclusive Intel by performing Investigations
4. Return to the Designer Column page and exchange Exclusive Intel for any prerequisite rewards
5. Tap the Designer's Reflection to buy it with Exclusive Intel

### <a name="fantasy">Sea of Fantasy</a>

The Sea of Fantasy is a type of **gacha** <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> game in *Shining Nikki.* You can Summon random items from the Sea of Fantasy using **Fantasy Tickets**, **Gleaming Shards** and **Gleaming Stars**.

To find the Sea of Fantasy, tap `Gate of Heart` at the bottom of the home page. There are 2 versions of the Sea of Fantasy. *Sea of Fantasy: Gleam* features an increased drop rate for featured sets. These featured sets rotate weekly. The same items are available in the regular Sea of Fantasy, but the drop rates are a little bit different. You can cycle through the different gacha games in the Gate of Heart by tapping the arrows on the left and right of your screen.

There is a third gacha <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> game in the Gate of Heart called the *Sea of Mystery*. There are currently no Designer's Reflections available to win in the Sea of Mystery.

`add images Gate of Heart`

The following table shows the drop rate of Designer's Reflections in the Gate of Heart by rarity. For a complete list of available items drop rates for each gacha game in the Gate of Heart, tap `All Items` in the upper right corner of your screen.

| Gacha Name | Designer's Reflections Available | SR Drop Rate | SSR Drop Rate | UR Drop Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Sea of Fantasy | Available | 6.2% | 3.0% | 0.5% | |
| Sea of Fantasy: Gleam | Available | 5.58% for featured sets; 0.62% for other sets | 2.7% for featured sets; 0.3% for other sets | 0.5% | Featured sets rotate weekly |
| Sea of Mystery | Unavailable | | | | Only clothing can be won in Sea of Mystery |

> **Did you know?**  
Because there is randomness involved in gacha <sup>[2](#gacha)</sup> games, there is a chance that you will receive duplicate items. Duplicate Designer's Reflections will automatically be turned into **echoes** <sup>[1](#echo)</sup>. Duplicate clothes and echoes can be Decomposed for Gold and upgrade materials. See `upgrades section on decomposition` for more information.

##### Fantasy Tickets

Fantasy Tickets can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as sign-in rewards, events, achievements, and more. Fantasy Tickets can also be purchased for Pink Gems, Guild Coins, Event Currency, or real money in the **Shop**<sup>[3](#shop)</sup>. You can quickly exchange Pink Gems for Fantasy Tickets by tapping `Summon` without any tickets in your inventory or `Summon x10` with less than 10 tickets in your inventory.

Summoning with 10 tickets at once will guarantee that you win at least one SSR item. Because many Designer's Reflections are rarity SSR and above, you may increase your odds of getting a Designer's Reflection by spending 10 Fantasy Tickets at once by tapping `Summon x10`. Keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to get a Designer's Reflection on every Summon, even if you use Summon x10. 

##### Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars

Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars are an additional currency that can be used to Summon in Sea of Fantasy: Gleam. Gleaming Shards and Gleaming Stars can be purchased with **Star Gems** <sup>[4](#stargem)</sup>. The drop rates when using Gleaming Shards or Gleaming Stars are no different than using Fantasy Tickets. They are just another currency you can use to play Sea of Fantasy: Gleam. Keep in mind that you are not guaranteed to get a Designer's Reflection on every Summon.

### <a name="arena">Diamond Arena</a>

Stylists can compete against one another in the Diamond Arena for the chance to purchase Diamond Arena Exclusive clothing sets, including the set's Designer's Reflection. Unlike the Designer Intel Hub, you can exchange for these items in any order if you meet the requirements to purchase them.

`add image diamond arena`

To locate the Diamond Arena from the home page, tap `Start Journey`, then tap `Diamond Arena`. 

To unlock the Designer's Reflection from the current exclusive set, you must finish the weekly competition in the appropriate Tier or higher. To see which Tier you need to finish in, tap `Shop` in the bottom right corner to be taken to the Arena Shop, then tap `Exchange` to see the Diamond Arena Exclusive Clothing set.

`add image of DA shop designer's reflection requirements`

In this example, the player must finish the week in the *Ruler of Future Reversed: 1-star* Tier or higher to purchase this Designer's Reflection.

> **Did you know?**  
Unlocking a Diamond Arena Exclusive item for purchase only needs to be done once per Season. Even if you finish at a lower Tier in subsequent weeks, you may still purchase the items you unlocked previously.

On the Diamond Arena page, tap `Dress Up` to coordinate three outfits based on the Weekly Theme. Unlike the previous game in the *Nikki* series - *Love Nikki: Dress Up Queen* - you compete with other stylists based on the combined Styling Power of all three outfits combined, rather than competing based on popular vote. You can change any of your three outfits at any point during the week, as well as change which Designer's Reflections you want to use.

Your combined Styling Power is also known as your Competence. You can see your current Competence and the Competence of your competitors listed beneath Tier Position. Your Competence updates in real time, so any upgrades you make to your Styling Power - such as upgrading your Designer's Reflections - will be updated automatically in your Competence score.

To challenge a stylist, tap on 1 of the 3 profile pictures at the bottom of the home page. Challenge stylists with a higher Tier Position than you to increase your own Tier Position. If you win, you will swap Tier Positions with the stylist you challenged; if you lose, your Tier Position will remain the same. You will receive the Diamond Arena currency *Flower of Odes* whether you win or lose, but you will earn a few more for winning. You can also tap the `Refresh` button to swap out the 3 stylists at the bottom of the page for 3 new ones.

`add image challenge rank up`

Remember: when other stylists challenge and defeat you, your Tier Position will decrease. You unlock Diamond Arena Exclusives based on the Tier you *finish* the week in, so keep an eye on your Tier Position throughout the week to make sure you don't dip below the required Tier. You have the entire Season to buy the Exclusive set pieces, so even if you can't reach the required Tier right away, you should still compete to collect Flowers of Odes and increase your Styling Power to eventually compete in the higher Tiers.

##### How to Obtain Designer's Reflections from the Diamond Arena:

1. Check the requirements to buy the Designer's Reflection in the Arena Shop
2. From the Diamond Arena page, tap `Dress Up` and coordinate three outfits based on the Weekly Theme
3. Return to the Diamond Arena page and tap on a player to challenge them and earn Flowers of Odes
4. Increase your Tier by challenging players with a higher Tier Position than you
5. Finish at or above the Tier required to unlock the Designer's Reflection for purchase
6. Purchase the Designer's Reflection using Flowers of Odes
