## Introduction

**Designer's Reflections** are collectables that make their debut in *Shining Nikki*. Each Designer's Reflection features one or more of Miraland's designers and corresponds to one of the designer's clothing sets. Simply equipping any Designer's Reflection will increase Nikki's Styling Power in the game's various challenges and competitions, but that's not all you can do with them. You can also learn more about Miraland's designers, unlock new clothing and artwork variations, and further strengthen Nikki's Styling Power by upgrading your Designer's Reflections and equipping them with Concepts.

> **Did you know?**  
> You can awaken your Designer's Reflections to earn new color variants of your clothing sets that are even more powerful than the original sets!

Whether you are new to the *Nikki* series or a veteran Stylist exploring the game's newest feature, this guide will teach you how to collect, upgrade, and use your Designer's Reflections to become an elite *Shining Nikki* Stylist.
